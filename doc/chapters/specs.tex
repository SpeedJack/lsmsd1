The product described in this paper is a \standout{restaurant table booking
application}. The main objective of the application is to allow restaurant
owners to make their restaurant known to a large number of people and allow

\standout{Customers} can use this application to see the list of available
restaurants, book a table in one of these restaurants with the possibility to
choose date, time and number of seats and see the list of bookings made (with
the possibility of deleting them).

they are open. In addition, the restaurant owner can see a list of bookings made
