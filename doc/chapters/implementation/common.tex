\subsection{Common Utilities}

This package contains the implementation of serializable classes which can be
exchanged among the client and the server in XML format. There are entities
classes that represents a simplification of the analysis classes.

Furthermore there are the \code{RequestMessage} and \code{ResponseMessage} which
are respectively representation of requests from the clients and responses from
the server.

These classes are composed by some fields which identifies the type of the
request and a set of \code{Entity} objects that are exchanged among the two
parties to fulfil the requests.

The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:common} shows the implementation of these classes
and their interconnections.
