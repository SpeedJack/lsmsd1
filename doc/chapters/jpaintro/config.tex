\section{Configuration of JPA with Hibernate}

If using Maven as dependency manager, in order to use JPA with Hibernate you
must add the dependency in the POM file, in particular:

\lstinputlisting[language=XML, label={lst:pomhibernate},
style=xmlcode,caption={Hibernate dependency for Maven POM
file.}]{pomhibernate.xml}

Furthermore the file \code{persistence.xml} must be created.

The \code{persistence.xml} file must be placed in the folder
\code{src/main/re\-sources/META-INF}. This file (shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:persistence}) is a standard configuration file. Its purpose is
to provide the \code{EntityManager} with the information necessary to
save/update/query the database and configure the mapping layer. The file defines
the persistence-units, groups of persistent classes with their settings,
providing them with a unique identifier that can be used by the application.

caption={\code{persistence.xml}}]{persistence.xml}
