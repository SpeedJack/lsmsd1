\chapter{Build Custom Queries}

JPA provides \standout{Criteria API}, an alternative way for defining JPA
queries, which is mainly useful for building dynamic queries with user-provided
parameters. In particular, we will see \code{CriteriaBuilder}.

\code{CriteriaBuilder} is used to construct criteria queries, compound
selections, expressions, predicates, orderings. An example of use is shown
below considering the \code{User} entity of this tutorial. In particular, we
want to find a user by searching for him through his \code{username} (and not
through his \code{Id} as the \code{find} method allows).
