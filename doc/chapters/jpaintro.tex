\chapter{JPA: Tutorial and Implementation}

JPA is a Java API specification for relational data management in applications.
JPA defines a standard way for simplifying database programming defining Java
Persistence Query Language (JPQL) which is an object-oriented query language
that operates against Java objects rather than directly with database tables.

JPA is Java standard specification for ORM (Object Relational Mapping), a
programming technique for the integration of object-oriented software with
RDBMS: with JPA a class (an Entity) represents a table stored in a database, an
instance of a class represents a row in the table and a member of an instance
represents a column.

There are various implementations of JPA\@. In this tutorial the Hibernate
implementation will be adopted.

In this tutorial we will show a simple implementation of JPA with Hibernate.
